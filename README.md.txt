# Orbis Challenge 2016



# This code is for the Orbis Challenge 2016 Hackathon conducted over a 24-hour timeframe. The objective of the hackathon was to build an
# AI bot using API for their bot-rampage game, and compete with other AI's.

# Currently, the code hosts various iterations of the AI built during the competition period, as well as the supporting framework/APIs.
