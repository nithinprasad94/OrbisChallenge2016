"# OrbisChallenge2016 

This contains API, Launcher and Application files related to the Orbis Bot Rampage game. In addition, it contains various iterations of 'AI' that I have written for the challenge (all code written in the 24-hour challenge duration). To view the AI that I wrote for the competition, please view: PlayerAI_version1 - PlayerAI_version6 in the OrbisChallenge2016/PyCharm/Cyber Team Zero/Bots/PythonAI folder; and as can be inferred from the subfolder path, the AI was programmed in Python.
